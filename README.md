This is the client side code for a full stack web application <br>
that was developed as part of a job interview process. <br>
It will always be hosted with a link to this code <br>
so that anybody else requesting something similar to this <br>
can be politely declined and pointed to this for examination.

####The requirments for this are as follows:
- Create a persistent tree that generates child nodes.<br>
Nodes are created by user input, with<br>
name, min max values and number of child nodes to be generated on user input.<br>
All values are editable. Child nodes are replaced on generating a new set.<br>
- All users should see changes made to component tree across all browsers.
- State is persistant, refreshing page does not undo current state.
- Must create the back end and database for project as well.
- Must host finished project. (AWS, Heroku, etc.)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The page reloads on edit.<br>
Lint errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info

### `npm run build`

Builds/bundles and optimizes React in production mode to the `build` folder.<br>
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more info.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

You can `eject` at any time. <br>
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. <br>
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies <br>
`Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc` right into your project so you have full control over them.<br>
All of the commands except eject will still work,<br>
but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.

**At this point you’re on your own. YOU `NEVER` HAVE TO RUN `EJECT`**
